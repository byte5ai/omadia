/**
 * #1071 — fold server-written routine deliveries into the local copy of a
 * chat without touching anything else.
 *
 * A scheduled routine created from the web chat appends its output to the
 * persisted session on the server (a `proactive` assistant message). The
 * web UI hydrates once per page load, so without a re-read the delivery only
 * shows after a full reload. The chat re-reads the session when the user
 * switches to it or the tab becomes visible again, and merges ADDITIVELY:
 * remote proactive messages missing locally are inserted, every other remote
 * difference is ignored — local state stays the source of truth while the
 * app runs.
 *
 * Placement mirrors the server's merge (`mergeServerProactiveMessages`):
 * before the first local USER message that started after the delivery, else
 * at the end — never between a question and its answer.
 *
 * Returns `local` itself when there is nothing to add, so a re-read that
 * finds nothing new causes no state change.
