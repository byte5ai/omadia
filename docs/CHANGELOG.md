## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md` reformatted to follow the Keep-a-Changelog convention.
  Detailed operational history prior to v0.1.0 is preserved in the git log.
- Replaced the internal `docs/security-migration-plan.md` post-mortem with
  `docs/security-architecture.md`, which describes the generic patterns
  (proxy-over-direct calls, secrets in a vault, scope-locked sub-agent tools)
  without incident-specific identifiers.
- Sanitised `middleware/packages/harness-diagrams` package metadata to remove
  internal hostnames and branding.
